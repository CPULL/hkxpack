Diff between FNIS-generated HKX file and default FNIS file (FNIS-Creatures)
based on ChaurusBehavior.hkx (meshes/actors/chaurus/behaviors)
* Converted to XML w/ hkxcmd
* XML analysis made w/ GIT
* File analysis made with HxD - Hexeditor

> Nearly all values in XML changed
	possible references between components generated by hkxcmd
	Ignored as possibly irrelevant
> __classnames__ changed
	Value 70 04 changed to A0 04 throughout the file
	> Checked @7004 and @A004 => No common ground
	> Checked @470 and @4A0 => Idem
	=> @D0 is the end of the header
	> Checked @470+D0 and @4A0+D0 (@540/@570)=> End of the "hkobject" definition ?
	Conclusion : __classnames__ value is the (reversed) offset to the end of classes declaration
	And/or __classnames__ is the size of the classes definition block
> __types__ changed
	Value 40 05 switched to 70 05
	> Checked @540 and @570 => see above
> __
	
> New base class (hkbBehaviorReferenceGenerator) @4F0
	Value 23 54 CB 0F
	No other values in header changed
> New event name (FNISDefault) @EEE0
> New... flag ? Under EventInfos
> Two new XML components (hkbBehaviorReferenceGenerator + hkbStateMachineStateInfo)
